Your goal is to model a parking lot using object-oriented programming principles. This project is relatively
open-ended; we will be grading based on your use of OOP principles.
Assumptions:
1. A parking lot has a capacity.
2. A parking lot has entrance and exit gates.
3. Cars receive a time-stamped ticket at entry.
4. Cars present the ticket at exit gates, pay and then leave the parking lot.
5. Cars cannot be admitted if there is no space in the parking lot.

Goal: The owners of parking lots want you to maximize their profits.
